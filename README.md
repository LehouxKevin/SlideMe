## ----------------------- More -----------------------

App not finished at 100%.


You can click first on the "Start" button to do the start rectangle of the effect using a drag selection, and click on the "End" button and do the second square of the final plan but the effect won't take custom settings, it's not working. The duration isn't used too.
Effects settings are saved into Json file but aren't read somewhere.
